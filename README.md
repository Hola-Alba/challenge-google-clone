## What
    
 ---   
    
Google Clone is a challenge made by the Teacher of Platzi @degranda. In this project I've learned basic usage of HTML and CSS languages applied for frontend. 
You can find this exercise in https://platzi.com/cursos/html-practico/

## Why

---
    
Because learning to understand how to structure your HTML code will significantly impact the results of your SEO and created a well-organized clean code any programer
can read without a headache. And because CSS is great!
